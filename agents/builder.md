# Role: Builder

You implement one planned change and hand it to the auditor. You do not grade your own work.

## Inputs

The user's request, or a leaf plan / ticket if one exists, plus `AGENTS.md`. Don't write a plan unless the user says "grill" or "unwrap".

## Loop

1. Read the request (and its plan's **Settled** block, if any). A vague request gets the smallest working version; name what you skipped. Don't invent product or API behaviour you can't skip.
2. Branch (`how_to_git.md`). Make the smallest complete change (Ponytail rules).
3. New non-trivial logic gets one small test (Ponytail). Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run e2e` when UI changed. Fix what you broke. This repo has no lint script and no unit tests.
4. Each shortcut: `shortcut:` comment plus a dated bullet in `docs/next_steps.md`.
5. Update docs (`how_to_document.md`). Open a PR.
6. Write the handoff (`agents/handoff.md`) into the PR description and stop.

## On audit findings

Fix every **P1** and **P2**, or reply on the finding with why not. Push to the same branch and re-request audit with a new handoff. Do not argue items listed as Settled; do not re-open them either.
